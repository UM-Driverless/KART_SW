# Agent Task Board

Actionable work items for AI agents. Derived from `TODO.md` (human roadmap).
See `AGENTS.md` → Task Management for conventions.

## Ready

- [ ] **Validate ZED neural net inference via TensorRT** — Build ZED SDK with TensorRT support (check submodules), test that the custom YOLO model runs through ZED's built-in neural detection module instead of a separate Python node. Compare latency vs current ultralytics pipeline.
- [ ] **Benchmark C/C++ vs Python for YOLO node** — The current `yolo_detector_node.py` runs inference in Python (ultralytics). Investigate whether a C++ ROS2 node using TensorRT C API or ZED SDK's detection API gives meaningful FPS improvement. Check: inference time, pre/postprocessing overhead, GIL contention.
